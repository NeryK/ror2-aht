Risk of Rain 2 Artificer hover toggle

## Description

On PC, the game Risk of Rain 2 lacks a toggle option for the Artificer survivor ENV Suit hover mode. The jump key has to be held to hover, which is annoying over long periods of time. This AutoHotkey script aims to mitigate that issue, without using mods such as [ArtificerToggleHover](https://thunderstore.io/package/bongopd/ArtificerToggleHover/) or [ENV_Toggle](https://thunderstore.io/package/FMRadio11/ENV_Toggle/).

It turns the Left Ctrl key into a toggle that replaces holding the Space key.

## Usage

### Instructions

- Download the RoR2ArtificerHoverToggleV2.exe executable file from the releases page.
- Execute it.
- Press F9 to stop it.

## Advanced

### Run from source

- Download and install [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) >= v2.0.
- Download RoR2ArtificerHoverToggleV2.ahk from this repository.
- Run the script.

### Change keys

The script can easily be modified to match custom bindings. Use the key names in the [AutoHotkey v2 List of Keys](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v2/KeyList.htm#keyboard).
